## The purpose of sprints: the experimental timebox

Development is organized into sprints not to force ourselves to do more (despite the name "sprint"), rather to institute the concept of "time-boxes". 

A time-box is like a little experiment frame. Within this block of time, we propose to do a target basket of work. How close to we get to delivering what we promised?
 
The standard Hack Reactor time-box is 2 days (See ** lecture slides). (In industry, it would be 1-week or 2-week sprints usually) Each time-box gives us a chance to review what we delivered, the highlights and lowlights, and determine how to improve in the next cycle.

## Sprint planning: prioritization, estimation, and commitment

Before kicking off a sprint, you make a sprint plan. You decide what deliverables youâ€™re going to produce in the next sprint, and plan out those deliverables at a just-enough level of detail to have logical substantiation for your estimates. 

There is always a difficult dance among competing factors: quality, speed, features, 

## Sprint retrospectives

You review what got delivered and what did not. What were the highlights and lowlights of the sprint, in terms of delivery and delivery quality?  What blockers and friction arose? What 2 or 3 things (a manageable, low number) will we try in the next sprint, to improve?

You file a few specific tickets in the next sprint to be real about addressing those process improvements.
